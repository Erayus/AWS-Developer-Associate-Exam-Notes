### **AWS Fundamentals**
---
#### EC2
- **SSH:**
  - Programmatic way to access your instance (port 22 needs to be open in a security group).
  - .pem file's permissions are required to change before being used as key to access the instance.
- **Instances Metadata**: SSH into intance and then `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`
- **User data section**: Input scripts to this section to setup the instance when it's initiated (e.g update packages, install web servers...)
- **Launch Types:**
  - ***On Demand***: short workload, predictable pricing, pay as you go. 
  - ***Reserved Instances***: long workloads (>= 1 year), pay upfront.
  - ***Convertible Reserved Instances***: long workloads with flexible instances.
  - ***Schedule Reserved Instances***: launch within time window you reserve.
  - ***Spot Instances***: short workloads, for cheap, can lose instances.
  - ***Dedicated Instances***: no other customers will share your hardware, expensive.
  - ***Dedicated Hosts***: book an entire physical server, control instance placement, highly expensive. 
- **Security group:**
  - Act as a fireware that controls traffic that goes into (inboud) and goes out (outbound) the instance.
  - Can be attached to multiple instances.
  - By default, all **inboud** is *blocked*, **outbound** is *authorized*.
  - **SG Referencing**: SGs can be used to authorize access between instances.
- **Billing:**
  - Billed by seconds
  - Billed for storage, data transfer, fixed IP public address, load balancing.
- **Custom AMI**:
  - Pre-installed packages needed.
  - Faster boot time (no need for long ec2 user data at boot time).
  - Machine comes configured with monitoring / enterprise software.
  - Security concerns - control over the machines in the network.
  - Control of maintenance and updates of AMIs over time.
  - Active Directory Integration out of the box.
  - *Installing your app ahead of time (for faster deploys when auto-scaling)*
  - *Built for a specific AWS region*
- **CPU Credits:** allow your instance to burst, credits are lost when bursting and earned when not bursting.
